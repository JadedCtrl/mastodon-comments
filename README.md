- No dependencies
- Light: less than 200 lines of code (including comments and spaces)
- Follows the **progressive enhancement strategy:**
- Build with modern javascript, using ES6 modules and custom elements

## Usage

### HTML

Write the following HTML code with a link to a post from Mastodon:

```html
<oom-comments src="https://mastodon.gal/@misteroom/110810445656343599">
  No comments yet
</oom-comments>
```

### JS

Register the custom element:

```js
import Comments from "./mastodon-comments/comments.js";

//Register the custom element with your desired name
customElements.define("oom-comments", Comments);
```

### CSS

Import the CSS code from this package or create your own.

```css
@import "./mastodom-comments/styles.css";
```

## Customization

You can customize the HTML code generated by overriding the default
`renderComment` static function:

```js
import Comments from "./mastodon-comments/comments.js";

// Customize the HTML rendering
Comments.renderComment = function (comment, utils) {
  // your render here
};

//Register the custom element with your desired name
customElements.define("oom-comments", Comments);
```

## Cache

Use the `cache` attribute to cache the API responses. It accepts a number with
the time in seconds. The cache is also used offline.

```html
<!-- Cache for 1 minute (60 seconds) -->
<oom-comments
  cache="60"
  src="https://mastodon.gal/@misteroom/110810445656343599">
  No comments yet.
</oom-comments>
```
